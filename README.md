# IFramework
An advanced Item Framework for paper (NOT SPIGOT)
This IS NOT compatible with spigot (I don't plan on making it for a while, however make an issue if you really need)

Currently, Items are not dynamic, and you might have to write your own Builder implementation if you need, you can also make it as a contribution, if there is an open issue for it.

# Contributing

If you wish to contribute, (which is much appreciated) I would prefer if you
looked through the open issues, find something that *as far as you know* no-one is working on.

After that, please make a comment on the issue stating that you are now working on it,
to tell other people that you are busy with that issue.

Once you are finished please make a pull request, and it will get reviewed.
